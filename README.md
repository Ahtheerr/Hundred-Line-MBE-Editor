# Using

[Here](https://hundred-line-mbe-editor.vercel.app/)

WARNING: This program was not updated/meant to use on "text" folder files, some of them work, but the program was made with "message" folder in mind. Will update it to support them eventually I guess.



# Building/Using yourself

Download and install Node.js/npm

``npm install``

``npm run dev``

This should do the thing ngl.
